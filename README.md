# 🚀 custom-compiler-c - Simple Compiler for Learning

## 🌟 Overview
custom-compiler-c is a compiler built from scratch in C using Flex and Bison. It performs lexical and syntax analysis, generating Intermediate Code known as Three-Address Code or Quadruples. This software helps users understand compiler construction concepts while providing a hands-on experience.

## 🥇 Key Features
- Understand the basics of compiler construction.
- Perform lexical analysis with Flex.
- Conduct syntax analysis using Bison.
- Generate Intermediate Code with backpatching logic.
- Explore symbol tables for variable management.

## 🔍 Understanding Key Concepts
Here are a few important concepts you will encounter while using the custom-compiler-c:

- **Lexical Analysis:** This phase breaks down the source code into tokens.
- **Syntax Analysis:** In this phase, the structure of the code is verified against the grammar rules.
- **Intermediate Code Generation:** This step produces a representation of the source code that is easier to manipulate for further processing.
- **Backpatching:** This technique allows for the easy referencing of labels and addresses during code generation.
- **Symbol Table:** A data structure used to store information about identifiers (like variables and functions).

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you run into issues while using custom-compiler-c, consider these common solutions:

- **Error Messages:** Pay close attention to error messages. They usually indicate what went wrong in the code.
- **Unsupported Syntax:** Make sure your source code complies with C syntax rules.
- **Permissions:** If you cannot run the executable, check your system's permissions and ensure you have the necessary rights.
- **Dependencies:** Ensure that Flex and Bison are installed if required.
